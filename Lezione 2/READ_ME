In Integral folder there is the all the material for the integral exercise
In Rwalk folder there is the all the material for the random walk exercise 

1) Integral estimation exercise

	with ./run.sh you can
	-compile the program with make (make)
	-run the executable (./integral.x)
	-move output files to data folder (the already existing files will be overwritten) (mv *.txt DATA/)
	
2) Random walk exercise

	to compile: make
	to run the executable: ./RW.x Nstep Nsim Nblocks dim
		-Nstep range of random walk steps to study ([1,2, ... ,Nstep])
		-Nsim number of random walk distances to sample to get the average distance estimate, at fixed number of step i in [1,2, ... ,Nstep]
		-Nblocks number of blocks in which we divide the Nsim estimates, for data blocking
		-dim dimension of the random walk
		
	./run.sh input: 
	allows to compile, run and move the outputs to the DATA folder (the already existing files will be overwritten), for every line of the input file
