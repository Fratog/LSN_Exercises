1)	
		The prorgram can be compiled with make 

2) 
		Executed by ./main.x row1 row2 Ncities L 
		Es. ./main.x 12312 921 34 1

		The executable needs the following input parameters
			
			row1: int from 1 to 30000, selects the prime numbers row to set the random generator in cities object
			row2: analogous but with population object
			Ncities: number of cities
			L: legtnh of square side
			
			An additional parameter can be added, this one allows to choose the type of selection operator
			1 for selection operator based on simulated annealing
			2 for the standard selection operator which works on a fitness-ordered population
			if not passed the program choose the standard selection operator as default
			./main.x 12312 921 34 1 1 ------> simulated annealing operator
			./main.x 12312 921 34 1 2 ------> standard operator
			./main.x 12312 921 34 1   ------> standard operator
			
	
3)
		./run.sh inputfile	
		run the program main.x with parameters given by the rows of the inputfile.
		
		inputfile: -------> ./run.sh inputfile
		line1								./main.x line1
		line2								./main.x line2
		...									...
		

4) the program has two outputs: 

		A)fit_square.txt : here there is the best fit of each generation and average fit on best half of the population at every generation.
		
		B)bound_fixedL.txt or bound_fixedL_SA.txt (depending on the selection operator choosen): 
		  it contains the best fit of the whole GA evolution. We are interested in this ouput only if we do multiple runs with ./run.sh inputfile
			if we use ./run.sh inputfile it will contain the best fit found for every execution with inputs given by inputfile rows.
			it is the ouput file we use to study the expected value of the minimum distance for N cities in a square of length 1.	
			
		C) e.g. 
			to obtain fit_square.txt: 				./main.x row1 row2 34 1
			to obtain bound_fixedL.txt: 			./run.sh input_fixedL.dat
			to obtain bound_fixedL_SA.txt:  	./run.sh input_fixedL_SA.dat
