	-to compile: make
	
	-to run the executable: ./Molecular.x
		A)the program opens the input file input.in in runtime and use its values for initialization
		B)in Averages() function in MD_MC.cpp there are two flags, obs_flag, gr_flag that can be modified to choose which observabes we want to compute. 

	-all the results can be obtained using the script run.sh: ./run.sh Tofev Nblocks Nsteps_x_block
		with:
			Tofev: is the type of move, MC for Monte Carlo, MD for Verlet.
			Nblocks: number of blocks
			Nsteps_x_blocks: number of Monte Carlo steps per block
			
		the script prepares the file input.in with the values found in  
			input.gas input.solid input.liquid (if Tofev=MC) 
			input.gas.verlet input.solid.verlet input.liquid.verlet (if Tofev=MD) 
		but also adding the custom values passed to the script: Tofev, Nblocks and Nsteps_x_block.
		
		then the script launch ./Molecular.x
		
		run.sh does NOT move automatically the ouputs to the correct folders, they must be moved by hand 
		
	-after having studied the equilibration process I added the following two lines in the main after the Input() call:
		for(int i=0; i<2000; i++)
			Move()
		which guarantee the equilibration.
		if you wish to study the equilibration process comment these lines.
