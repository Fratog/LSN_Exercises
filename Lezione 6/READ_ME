	-to compile: make
	
	-to run the executable: ./Monte_Carlo_ISING_1D.x temp nspin J h metro nblk nstep restart
		where	:
		temp is the temperature
		nspin is the number of spin
		J is the Hamiltonian coupling
		h is the extern magnetic field
		metro is a flag, 1 for Metropolis sampling 0 for Gibbs sampling
		nblk is the number of blocks
		nstep is the total number of step per block
		restart is a flag, 1 for restaring from previous configuration, 0 for new initialization
		
	-to get the equilibration results we used: ./run_eq.sh Nist_values
		where	: 
		Nist_values is the number of istanentous values to get to check the equilbration using energy as observable of reference.
	
		After having found the equilibration time we added the following lines
		
		for(int i=0; i<2000; i++) //equilibration
			Move(metro);
			
		immediately after the Initialization in the main. This way every run will be equilibrated and we don't have to worry about it.
		So if you wish to study the equilibration process, comment these two lines.
		
	-to get the observables prediction we used: ./run.sh input.dat samp_flag h
		where:
		input.dat is a file containg the values of, temp nspin J h metro nblk nstep restart, to pass to the executable. 
		samp_flag is a flag, use M for Metropolis sampling, G for Gibbs sampling
		h is the external magnetic field
		
		all the results in DATA/Metropolis and DATA/Gibbs are obtained and moved to the correct folder with the following commands:
		./Monte_Carlo_ISING_1D.x input.dat M 0
		./Monte_Carlo_ISING_1D.x input.dat M 0.02
		./Monte_Carlo_ISING_1D.x input.dat G 0
		./Monte_Carlo_ISING_1D.x input.dat G 0.02
		
		ATTENTION: if you want to work with zero external magnetic field pass as input 0 and not 0.0 or any other floating point 0
		(if 0.0 is used there is a problem in the run.sh script I still haven't corrected).
